        <h1>History of Netball in New Zealand</h1>
        <p>History. Netball was introduced to New Zealand as 'women's basketball' in 1906 or 1907 by Rev. J. C. Jamieson. The game spread across New Zealand through primary and secondary schools, although different playing rules emerged in different areas.</p>
